# Samudra Paket ERP - Integration Testing Plan (Phase 1)

## Overview
This document outlines the integration testing strategy for Phase 1 of the Samudra Paket ERP system. The tests focus on ensuring that different components of the system work together correctly, validating end-to-end flows, and verifying that the system meets the requirements specified in the SRS.

## Test Environment
- **Database**: MongoDB Memory Server (for isolated testing)
- **Testing Framework**: Jest
- **API Testing Tool**: Supertest
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication

## Test Categories

### 1. Authentication Flows
- User registration and email verification
- Login with verified credentials
- Login with unverified credentials (negative test)
- Password reset flow
- Token refresh mechanism
- Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
- Session management and logout

### 2. Role and Permission Management
- Role creation with specific permissions
- Role modification and permission updates
- Role deletion
- Permission enforcement on protected endpoints
- Role assignment to users
- Role hierarchy and inheritance
- Permission validation across different modules

### 3. Branch Management
- Branch creation with complete details
- Branch listing with pagination and filtering
- Branch details retrieval
- Branch update operations
- Branch deactivation/activation
- Service area management for branches
- Branch access control based on user permissions

### 4. Employee Management
- Employee creation with all required fields
- Employee profile updates
- Employee assignment to branches and positions
- Employee status management (active/inactive)
- Employee search and filtering
- Employee data validation
- Employee access control based on user permissions

### 5. Performance Testing
- Response time for critical API endpoints
- Performance under load for frequently used endpoints
- Database query performance
- API response time with pagination and filtering
- Search functionality performance

### 6. Security Testing
- Authentication security (password policies, token validation)
- Authorization security (proper permission enforcement)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- Rate limiting and brute force protection
- Data encryption and sensitive information handling

## Test Execution Strategy
1. Run unit tests first to ensure individual components work correctly
2. Execute integration tests to validate component interactions
3. Perform end-to-end tests for critical user flows
4. Conduct performance tests to ensure system meets performance requirements
5. Run security tests to verify system security

## Reporting
Test results will be documented with:
- Pass/fail status for each test case
- Performance metrics for critical endpoints
- Security vulnerabilities identified
- Recommendations for improvements

## Continuous Integration
Integration tests will be incorporated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that new changes don't break existing functionality.
