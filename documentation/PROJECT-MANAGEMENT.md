# Project Management Tools and Issue Tracking

## Overview

This document outlines the project management tools and issue tracking processes used in the Samudra Paket ERP project. These tools help us manage tasks, track progress, and collaborate effectively.

## GitHub Issues and Projects

### GitHub Issues

We use GitHub Issues as our primary issue tracking system. All bugs, feature requests, and tasks should be tracked as GitHub Issues.

#### Issue Templates

We have the following issue templates:
- **Bug Report**: For reporting bugs and defects
- **Feature Request**: For suggesting new features
- **Task**: For general development tasks
- **Documentation**: For documentation-related tasks

#### Issue Labels

Issues are categorized with the following labels:
- `bug`: Indicates a bug or defect
- `feature`: Indicates a new feature
- `enhancement`: Indicates an improvement to existing functionality
- `documentation`: Indicates documentation-related tasks
- `frontend`: Related to frontend code
- `backend`: Related to backend code
- `mobile`: Related to mobile app code
- `high-priority`: Requires immediate attention
- `medium-priority`: Should be addressed soon
- `low-priority`: Can be addressed later

### GitHub Projects

We use GitHub Projects for sprint planning and tracking. Each sprint has its own project board with the following columns:
- **Backlog**: Issues that are not yet scheduled
- **To Do**: Issues planned for the current sprint
- **In Progress**: Issues currently being worked on
- **Review**: Issues waiting for code review
- **Done**: Completed issues

## Jira (Optional)

For more complex project management needs, we may use Jira. If Jira is used, it will be integrated with GitHub to sync issues and status updates.

## Communication Tools

### Slack

We use Slack for day-to-day communication. The following channels are available:
- `#general`: General discussion
- `#development`: Technical discussion
- `#announcements`: Important announcements
- `#bugs`: Bug reports and discussions

### Google Meet / Zoom

We use Google Meet or Zoom for:
- Daily standups (15 minutes)
- Sprint planning (2 hours at the beginning of each sprint)
- Sprint review (1 hour at the end of each sprint)
- Sprint retrospective (1 hour at the end of each sprint)

## Documentation

### Confluence (Optional)

For comprehensive documentation, we may use Confluence. If used, it will contain:
- Project requirements
- Architecture documentation
- API documentation
- User guides
- Meeting notes

### Google Drive

We use Google Drive for sharing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations that don't fit into the GitHub repository.

## Development Workflow

1. **Issue Creation**: All work starts with a GitHub Issue
2. **Branch Creation**: Create a branch from the issue using the naming convention `type/issue-number-short-description` (e.g., `feature/123-add-login-page`)
3. **Development**: Work on the issue in the branch
4. **Pull Request**: Create a pull request when the work is ready for review
5. **Code Review**: At least one team member must review and approve the pull request
6. **Merge**: After approval, the pull request can be merged
7. **Issue Closure**: The issue is automatically closed when the pull request is merged

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

We use GitHub Actions for CI/CD, which is integrated with Railway for deployment. The workflow is:
1. **Push to Branch**: Triggers tests and linting
2. **Pull Request**: Triggers tests, linting, and preview deployment
3. **Merge to Develop**: Triggers deployment to staging environment
4. **Merge to Main**: Triggers deployment to production environment

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have access to the GitHub repository
2. Join the Slack workspace
3. Familiarize yourself with the issue templates and labels
4. Review the current GitHub Projects board to understand ongoing work
